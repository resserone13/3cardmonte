Three card money game using Pythonista scene model

I am new to programming. 
This is my first complete project. 
I Would like to convert this code 
to better code and learn in the process. 
I would like to re-write this 
using more classes And functions. 
Thank you to everyone who answered my questions
I had while making this.
